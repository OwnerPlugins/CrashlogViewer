## 🛠️ Code Structure

* `CrashLogScreen` — Main UI and logic class managing scanning, listing, and user commands.
* Adaptive skin XML layouts tailored for screen resolutions.
* Uses Enigma2 widgets like `List`, `StaticText`, `ActionMap` for UI controls.
* File operations performed via Linux shell commands and Python's `os` and `stat` modules.

---

## ⚙️ Dependencies

* Enigma2 Python environment.
* Enigma2 UI modules (e.g., `Screen`, `List`, `StaticText`).
* Linux filesystem access with proper permissions.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* The plugin depends on shell commands (`ls`) to list files and get metadata.
* Ensure the plugin has the correct permissions to read and delete log files.
* Intended for Enigma2 satellite receivers; functionality outside this environment is not guaranteed.
